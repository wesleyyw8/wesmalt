# Malangular

makes sense): done  
* Use Sass (preferably SCSS syntax) for your CSS needs: done (with less)  
* Make a responsive design: done  
* Create some unit tests (would be nice to see end to end tests as well): done  
* Cache the API resources: done  
* Use animations (mix of Angular animations and pure CSS animations would be nice): done (only angular animations tho)  
* Use Angular routing/lazy loading.: done
